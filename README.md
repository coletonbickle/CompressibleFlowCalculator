# CompressibleFlowCalculator
Here is where I will keep all python files related to my Compressible Flow Calculator.
Currently, both the Isentropic Flow Relations and Normal Shock Relations are fully functional with a functional GUI.
Regretably, I have decided to end all future work on this project.
I have met all my learning objectives that I have set for myself and futher work would become repetitive.
I would like to focus on other projects to help expand my growing coding knowledge.
